# PD-UBI: Passion-Driven Universal Basic Income
### & Personal Data Sovereignty

## 📄 The Proposal

This is a proposal for a new economic paradigm: **Money can be minted by human passion.**

## The Operating Mechanism of "Passion-Driven Universal Basic Income"

This is a **dual-token system** featuring two types of tokens: Token A and Token B. Token A cannot be traded directly on the market, whereas Token B is the actual currency used for circulation.

Every week, the system distributes some Token A to everyone. These Token A cannot be transferred between wallets. The only thing you can do with them is to **"like"** others.

Each "like" consumes **1 Token A** and simultaneously generates **1.5 Token B**:
* **1.0 Token** returns to you (this is your UBI/basic wage);
* **0.5 Token** is rewarded to the person being liked (this is a vote to support what you love).

**You will realize that with every "like," you are actually conducting a micro-issuance of currency.**

For every transaction made with Token B, a **1% "tax"** is collected by the system. These collected fees are converted back into Token A proportionally and distributed to everyone the following week, creating a continuous economic flow loop.

The origin of Token A is anchored to **"people."** When you join the system, it automatically sends some Token A exclusively to you. Subsequently, you will receive Token A every week derived from the converted Token B taxes.

To prevent someone from using 1,000 bots to farm money, we need to confirm that **"you are a unique real person."** Therefore, if you want to participate in this system, you need a **"Personal Sovereign Server"** capable of proving your uniqueness. This server will be used on the network to prove that **"you are you,"** not someone else, and not a robot.
