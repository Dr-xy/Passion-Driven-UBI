Proposal: Passion-Driven Universal Basic Income (PD-UBI) & Personal Data Sovereignty

1. Executive Summary
The current global monetary system is built upon "debt" and "centralized credit," resulting in severe wealth polarization and data totalitarianism. This proposal introduces a novel economic paradigm: Passion-Driven Universal Basic Income (PD-UBI).
This system utilizes a Dual-Token Mechanism to decentralize the power of currency issuance from central banks to every individual. The core logic is to quantify "the passion and attention of individuals within a group" into currency.
Simultaneously, by integrating the Personal Server as a hardware-level proof of identity, we aim to construct a digital system that is decentralized, anti-inflationary, adjustable, and protective of data sovereignty. This represents a leap from a "Digital City-State" to "Personal Sovereign Freedom."

2. The Economic Model: PD-UBI
The protocol adopts a segregated design featuring Token A (Voting Rights) and Token B (Circulating Currency).
2.1 Dual-Token Definitions
Token A (The Ballot):
	•	Attributes: Non-tradable, non-transferable, issued periodically, resets periodically.
	•	Function: Represents the individual's "Right to Define Value" and "Governance Voting Rights."
	•	Origin of Issuance:
	◦	The generation of Token A does not rely on computational power (hashrate) but is strictly anchored to "Human Existence."
	•	Initial Distribution:
	◦	Any participant who joins the system via identity verification triggers the generation of Token A immediately upon confirmation. To prevent sudden supply shocks, the generated Token A for new users is released gradually over a period of 10 weeks.
	◦	(Note: Token A represents the "right to social participation" inherent to being human. It is a birthright to exist and express passion, not capital acquired post-facto.)
Token B (The Currency):
	•	Attributes: Freely tradable, divisible, storable.
	•	Function: Medium of exchange for the market; used to purchase goods and services.
	•	Initial Allocation: Generated solely by consuming Token A.
2.2 Passion-Driven Allocation
"Every 'like' is a micro-issuance of currency."
Currency is no longer printed out of thin air by a central bank but is minted by the "passionate actions" of individuals.
	•	Operation: A user consumes 1 Token A to "like" (vote for) a person or creation they value.
	•	Conversion Formula: 1.0 Token A -> 1.5 Token B
	•	Distribution Ratio: Upon consuming 1 Token A:
	◦	1.0 Token B is returned to the liker (as the UBI base income for participating in value discovery).
	◦	0.5 Token B is rewarded to the receiver (as social recognition for the value created).

3. Circulation & Stability
To prevent hyperinflation and maintain system metabolism, a closed-loop recirculation mechanism is introduced.
3.1 Tax Recirculation
	•	Rule: Every transfer or transaction of Token B within the system incurs an automatic 1% Protocol Fee.
	•	Destination: This fee is directly Burned and an equivalent value is recorded in the "Public Reserve Pool."
	•	Regeneration: The funds collected in the Public Reserve serve as the anchor. The system calculates and mints Token A for the next cycle based on the macro-balance formula: 1.5 Token B Burned = 1.0 Token A Regenerated, redistributing it to all participants.
	•	Significance: The faster the currency circulates, the higher the UBI issuance. Currency is not just a store of wealth, but flowing energy.
3.2 Buffer Pool & Issuance Smoothing
	•	Setup: The system reserves up to 30% of additional Token B in the Public Reserve Pool at Genesis.
	•	Function: Acts as the "Algorithmic Central Bank" reserve, used to execute the "Issuance Smoothing Algorithm."
	•	The Smoothing Rule: To ensure the stability of UBI expectations and avoid drastic fluctuations:
	◦	Moving Average Anchor: The total issuance of Token A for the week does not depend solely on the previous week's immediate tax revenue but must adhere to a percentage based on the 10-week Moving Average of tax recirculation.
	◦	Volatility Circuit Breaker: The system caps the maximum fluctuation of weekly issuance at ±15% of the 10-week average.
	▪	Peak Shaving: If weekly tax revenue surges and the calculated issuance exceeds 15% of the average, the excess is automatically deposited into the Buffer Pool.
	▪	Valley Filling: If weekly tax revenue plummets and the calculated issuance falls below 15% of the average, the Buffer Pool automatically covers the deficit.
	◦	(Note: If the Buffer Pool accumulation exceeds ±30% of the baseline, the Protocol Fee is automatically adjusted by ±0.25% to either cool down or stimulate market heat.)

4. Infrastructure & Identity
To solve the "Sybil Attack" problem in decentralized systems, the protocol must verify that "you are you" on the open internet. This is a challenge, for which we propose the concept of the Personal Server.
4.1 The Personal Server
	•	Definition: Every participant must own a physically independent Personal Sovereign Server. This is not merely a computing device; it is the participant's "Physical Anchor" and "Unique Digital Shell" in the digital world.
	•	Identity Anchoring: Your digital identity is cryptographically bound to the hardware fingerprint of this server. This server is your sole credential for existing on the internet, ensuring identity cannot be generated out of thin air or mass-replicated.
Core Functions:
	•	Hardware-based DID: Uses a built-in Secure Element to provide unforgeable cryptographic signatures, proving "I am a unique real human."
	•	Proof of Humanity: Only nodes that verify "you are you" (and not an AI script) are eligible to receive Token A distribution. This is the firewall separating real human society from automated AI programs.
	•	Decentralized Node: The Personal Server acts as a distributed node in the network, automatically handling PD-UBI like signatures, transaction verification, and ledger maintenance.
	•	Sovereign Data Vault: The server stores personal medical, social, and financial data locally in the user's home. It is open only to external applications authorized by the user (Privacy-First), with fully customizable permissions.
Current Challenges & Transition:
	•	The Hardware Gap: There is currently no consumer-grade server or OS that fully meets these "Personal Sovereignty" standards. This requires entirely new hardware and a new Operating System designed strictly for personal authenticity.
	•	The Cold Start Problem: Before the PD-UBI system is proven viable, we must explore transitional verification schemes. Ensuring identity authenticity without specialized hardware when a mass influx of users occurs remains a significant engineering challenge.
4.2 The Crisis & Reconstruction of Identity
For too long, we have ceded the power of "identity verification" to third-party institutions (governments, banks, tech giants). In the Web 2.0 era, we became serfs to big data, losing both privacy and control over our own data. In the approaching AI era, we face a graver challenge: the internet is becoming flooded with manufactured opinions from bots. We need to reclaim data sovereignty from big corporations. More urgently, we need to reclaim the voice of real humans from the noise generated by algorithms.
The problem we face is this: Identity must be fully self-custodied to guarantee security, yet must possess public verifiability to access society. Building a system that exists as an "Independent Internet Entity" while proving to the world "I am indeed me" is a question we must seriously contemplate and solve.

5. Governance
5.1 Dynamic Code as Law
The laws of the system are not static texts, but dynamic code parameters.
	•	DAO Governance: Every participant eligible for Token A holds voting rights.
Adjustable Parameters: All system parameters can be modified through a vote by all participants.
	•	Core Control Lever: The Fee Rate. The Protocol Fee is not just tax; it is the system's "Macro-Control Tool" (similar to interest rates in traditional finance):
	◦	Fighting Inflation (Cooling): When the market overheats and prices soar, participants can vote to raise the fee (e.g., 1% -> 1.5%). This accelerates Token B burning, reducing money supply while increasing UBI issuance to support livelihoods.
	◦	Fighting Depression (Stimulus): When the economy stagnates, participants can vote to lower the fee (e.g., 1% -> 0.5%). This reduces transaction friction, encouraging investment and consumption to stimulate recovery.
5.2 Direct Voting
	•	There are no agents or delegates; participants must vote personally.
	•	Tacit Approval: Low voter turnout is viewed as tacit approval of the current system state. It implies current parameters are functioning well; only when widespread pain points arise will participants actively trigger change through voting.

6. Vision
From "Digital City-State" to "Personal Sovereignty"
The internet has passed through the wild age of exploration (Web 1.0) and the monopoly of platform empires (Web 2.0). It is now time to step into the "Democratic Era" of the internet. Through PD-UBI and the Personal Server, we hope to build a world where everyone can control themselves and drive what they love.
Unlocking "Programmable Social Systems"
In reality, if we truly realize the Personal Sovereign Server, we can overlay an "Immutable Ture Identity" onto the "Infinite Convenience of the Internet." Perhaps this will open the door to "Programmable Social Systems."
The most important premise is that this capability for personal sovereignty must be controlled by each individual, not defined by other organizations or institutions.
On this foundation, you can choose the social system you prefer.
	•	For example, a parallel economic system could exist: simply remove the step where Token A converts back to Token B for the self. We would then realize a "No-UBI, Passion-Driven Competitive Economy."
	•	Could we also try a social system driven by Resources?
	•	Or, a social system driven by Cuteness?
Everything is possible.
Furthermore, you can still live in the wild internet. The Personal Sovereign Server is not mandatory. I believe that as long as you can provide real value, even living a life of barter, you can still stay away from all these systems and live purely in an internet or physical world without any certification.
